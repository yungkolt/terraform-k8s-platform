   - HPA for applications (CPU/Memory)
   - Cluster autoscaler for nodes
   - Scheduled scaling for dev/test

4. **Monitoring**
   - Cost allocation by namespace
   - Budget alerts
   - Optimization recommendations

### Estimated Monthly Costs

- Compute (Regular): $150
- Compute (Spot): $60
- Storage: $50
- Monitoring: $100
- Load Balancer: $25
- **Total**: ~$385/month

## Deployment Workflow

### Standard Flow

1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Opens pull request with changes
3. CI/CD pipeline runs:
   - Kubernetes manifest validation
   - Security scanning (Trivy, Kubesec)
   - Policy validation (OPA)
   - Integration tests
4. Team lead reviews and approves
5. Merge to main branch
6. Flux CD detects changes (within 5 minutes)
7. Automated deployment to production
8. Health checks and monitoring
9. Automatic rollback if issues detected

### Emergency Deployment

1. Direct kubectl deployment (break glass)
2. Record action in audit log
3. Create retroactive PR
4. Update Git to match reality

## SRE Practices

### Golden Signals Monitoring

**Latency**
- Target: p99 < 1 second
- Measured at ingress
- Per-service breakdown

**Traffic**
- Requests per second
- By service and endpoint
- Peak vs average tracking

**Errors**
- Target: < 0.1% error rate
- 5xx responses tracked
- Client vs server errors

**Saturation**
- CPU target: < 70%
- Memory target: < 80%
- Network I/O monitoring

### SLO Definitions

**Availability SLO**: 99.9%
- Maximum 43.2 minutes downtime/month
- Measured by successful requests
- Excludes planned maintenance

**Latency SLO**: 99%
- 99% of requests complete < 1 second
- Measured at 5-minute intervals
- Separate targets for read/write

**Error Budget Policy**:
- 50% budget consumed: Alert to team
- 75% budget consumed: Freeze non-critical deployments
- 100% budget consumed: All hands on deck

## Security Compliance
